         <h2>About</h2>
         <p class="p-welcome">Hi I’m Ruqaiyyah or Kya, I’m 22 years old and I was born in Philadelphia.
           I have been an artist for years and art has been one of my major strength,
           art to me is often considered the process or product of deliberately
           arranging elements in a way that appeals to the senses or emotions.
           It encompasses a diverse range of my activities, creations and ways of expression,
           including drawing, graphic design, music, acting, sculpture and paintings.
           This is why I feel like I’m very skillful.</p>
