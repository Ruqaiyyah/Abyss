            Some of the cool interesting things
            I did over the winter break was meeting
            people in Vr and playing video games with my best friends.
            One of the games I played in Vr with my friends was called
            Vrchat and basically you can become any crazy cool avatar
            that suits your liking and go to many different worlds and
            play fun games or watch movies as you interact and meet new
            people, I actually became good friends with few people I met
            in that game and thought them how to draw, paint, and overcome
            their depression and anxiety.
